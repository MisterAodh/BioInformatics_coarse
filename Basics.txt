This is actually the first project where I am using the command line to push to my GIT
This is one of the few real issues of being nearly entirely self taught is I previously didnt bother to learn to do this and waster a lot of time
I am leaving these commands here in case I forget.

git add .
git commit -m "Describe the changes you've made"
git push
