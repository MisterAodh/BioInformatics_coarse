DNA codon are the nucliotide basses that encode for different amino acids
DNA and RNA have different charts as RNa is the translated verion of dna
mRNA AUG codon leads to tRNA codon UAC we look at the mRNA codon
use mRNA codon ahhhhhh
ribosoms: assemble polymeric protein molecules whose sequence is controlled by the sequence of messenger RNA molecules
a ribosome concists of two units a small small sub unit which reads RNA and a large sun unit which joins amino acids  to form a polypeptide chain.











This is actually the first project where I am using the command line to push to my GIT
This is one of the few real issues of being nearly entirely self taught is I previously didnt bother to learn to do this and waster a lot of time
I am leaving these commands here in case I forget.

git add .
git commit -m "Describe the changes you've made"
git push

The course will teach how to represent DNA and then build tools to analyse data, then
create algorithms to analyse data,

The projects will be rosalind challenges
